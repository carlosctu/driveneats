## About The Project

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72350887/173463024-dcfec059-5551-44cb-b00b-42fa1eb48f5c.png)

<p align="justify"> My third project at Driven Education Bootcamp. On this project we create "DrivenEats" a Fast Food App developed using HTML, CSS and Javascript. In the project, you will see a lot of dishes from my country, Peru.
The app is only available for mobile users, so if you don't want to see a cat showing a "404 Error", do not open the link on a desktop haha</p>
